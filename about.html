                <p>I serve as a Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force and I am the Superintendent for the 225th ADS Joint Interface Control Cell.<br>
                I spend my days taking care of my people while ensuring data links stay operational in the defense of North America. The military has given me the opportunity to meet many outstanding people and grow the next generation of Air Defenders, I am very fortunate to be supervising so many amazing people!</p>

                <p>I was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri in 1986 and lived there until I joined the USAF in 2004.  While in Cape I attended Saint Mary's Cathedral School as well as Notre Dame Regional Catholic Highschool and was 1st chair trumpet for NDHS band.  Prior to joining the USAF I worked for the local movie theatre.</p>

                A 2024 Retirement!  I plan to retire to a cabin by the lake with my kids, husband, dogs, and cats. I want to live happily taking care of my family and drinking coffee on the porch.</p>
